Finding oriC Problem: Finding oriC in a genome.
• Input. A genome.
• Output. The location of oriC in the genome.

def find_oric(genome):
    # Initialize variables to track GC skew
    gc_skew = [0] * (len(genome) + 1)
    min_skew = 0
    min_skew_positions = []

    # Calculate GC skew
    for i in range(1, len(genome) + 1):
        if genome[i - 1] == 'C':
            gc_skew[i] = gc_skew[i - 1] - 1
        elif genome[i - 1] == 'G':
            gc_skew[i] = gc_skew[i - 1] + 1
        else:
            gc_skew[i] = gc_skew[i - 1]

        if gc_skew[i] < min_skew:
            min_skew = gc_skew[i]
            min_skew_positions = [i]
        elif gc_skew[i] == min_skew:
            min_skew_positions.append(i)

    # The oriC is often near the position with the minimum GC skew
    return min_skew_positions

# Example usage:
genome = "your_genome_sequence_here"
oric_positions = find_oric(genome)
print("Predicted oriC positions:", oric_positions)
